  ## Installation
  This application only has a back-end so you will need to run commands from your terminal to test your routes before deploying with the frontend. Once you've cloned this repository, you will need to install the necessary packages (refer to packages.json), provide a username and password for mysql, and run 'npm start' to start the server.

  ## Usage
  You will need to use an API platform, such as Insomnia, to test your routes.
